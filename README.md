# sencha-demo
This is a simple app built with Sencha's EXTJS 5.1.

The app shows data in a grid for a set of American stocks. Upon clicking a row, a graph shows recent historical price data for that stock

Use --recursive when cloning the repo to get the php stock api submodule needed to get the data. After cloning, run "sencha app build" from inside the stocks directory. 

Links to download sencha cmd, needed to build the app after cloning, can be found [here](https://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?297477-Sencha-Cmd-5.1.1-GA-is-Now-Available)
